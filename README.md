## Overview

_**Rippertoire** is the web app that every guitarist needs to make sure they've got the material ready for upcoming gigs. It's not easy keeping hours of music and lyrics properly inventoried in your noggin, so I've developed this app to keep track of the data._

### Core Features

_The most challening part about memorizing hours worth of music is the thousands of words that go along with it. On Rippertoire, musicians can maintain lists 

  - _Future - for songs that you'd like to learn,_
  - _Current - for works in progress,_
  - _Past - for songs that are an active part of your repertoire, and need no brushing up on._

Musicians can store the lyrics to the songs that they're learning OR writing in any of the given lists.
For each song, a user should be able to input the Artist and title.

Future future features please refer to the [Post-MVP](#Post-MVP) section .

### Goals

- _Users should be able to tag each song as:_
  - _an 'original' or a 'cover'_
  - _Future, Current, or Past

### Team

Created, designed, and developed by [James Madison](https://github.com/mishakessler) for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (November '19 Cohort) Unit 4 Project.

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
